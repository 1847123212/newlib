What's new:
-----------

- New APIs: getcontext, setcontext, makecontext, swapcontext.

- New functions: sigsetjmp, siglongjmp.
  These were only available as macros up to now, but POSIX requires that
  siglongjmp has to be available as function.


What changed:
-------------

- When started from a non-Cygwin process, check if $HOME starts with a
  slash (absolute POSIX path).  Otherwise ignore it.


Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix potential hang running ldd(1).
